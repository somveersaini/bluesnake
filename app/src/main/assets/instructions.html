		<h1>Welcome!</h1>
		
		<h2>Display and Game Settings</h2>
		<p>The "User Control" setting, when enabled, allow you to touch to the top, bottom, left, and right of the screen center to influence The Man's movements. Remember, these directions are calculated from the center of the screen and NOT from The Man's current position.</p>
		<p>The layout of the grid has been optimized by default for WVGA devices (800x480, 854x480, etc.). If you are using a HVGA device (480x320) the grid might not line up with your icons by default.</p>
		<p>You can adjust the location of the grid by changing the top and bottom padding in the settings. Once in the settings, go to the "Display" category and then click the "Grid Padding" option. From here you can tweak the top and bottom padding (the offset from the edge of the screen) to your liking. Try starting with a top value of 25 and a bottom value of 50 and then adjusting to your liking.</p>
		<p>If you are using a launcher other than the default one (ADW.Launcher, Launcher Pro, etc.) and have changed the number of icon rows and columns you will need to change that setting in the wallpaper too. They are located under "Display" as "Icon Rows" and "Icon Columns" settings.</p> 
		
		<h2>Color Settings</h2>
		<p>Along with changing gameplay, you can customize nearly every color of the wallpaper to your liking. By default the colors have been styled to emulate a TI graphing calculator screen.</p>
		<p>Create your own color scheme to match your phone theme or favorite colors. If you aren't ready to fully give up a picture wallpaper you can even have a static image as the background by choosing "Background Image" under "Game Board" in the "Color" category.</p>
		
		<h2>Reset</h2>
		<p>If at any time you totally screw up your settings and just want to return them to their defaults, each main category contains a reset option at the bottom of the screen. This will only reset the settings related to that category.</p>
		<p>If you want to reset all of the wallpaper settings to default then there is a "Reset" option in the menu on the main settings screen. This will reset every setting back to its initial state.</p>
		
		<h2>Bugs? Force closes?</h2>
		<p>ALWAYS report bugs and force closes to <a href="mailto:ism2013017@iiita.ac.in">Somveer Saini</a>. There are a lot of devices and thousands of settings combinations which I probably have not had the opportunity to test and your feedback will help improve the wallpaper. Emails are infinitely more helpful than negative feedback on the Market.</p>
		<p>Questions, comments, and suggestions are also always welcome too!</p>
